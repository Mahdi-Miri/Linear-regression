# Linear-regression
This Python project implements a linear regression model to predict student grades (G3) based on features like age, absences, and previous grades. It loads and preprocesses student data, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance through scatter plots and accuracy scores.

Key Features:

Data loading and preprocessing (feature selection).
Data visualization (histograms).
Linear regression model training.
Model evaluation (accuracy score, scatter plots).
Prediction visualization (real vs. predicted values).
Technologies:

NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Use Case:

Predicting student performance using linear regression.
